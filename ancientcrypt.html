				<b>Introduction</b><br>
				The main task for this assignment was to create a simple 2D game representing a dungeon that the player is trapped in. 
				The only exit (X) is blocked by a boulder (B) which can only be moved once the player has picked up enough enery bars (E). 
				The dungeon is scattered with evil mummies (M) wandering randomly, and if the player touches one, they will perish. 
				Spades (S) are scattered around the dungeon and can be used to dig a hole to trap a mummy for several moves, or kill the player himself. <br><br>
				
				My take on the task was met with several advanced (for the time in my studies) features which made my game stand out. These included:
				A seed-generated dungeon that abided by rules to remain playable, and special Mummies that would try and follow the player.<br><br>
				
				My design, implementation, and testing achieved full marks, which I was immensly proud of.
